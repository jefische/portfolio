This web project helps tennis fans navigate the alternatives to watching tennis online.  If you're looking to cut the cord there are multiple options to watch tennis with just an internet connection. Traditional cable subscriptions can be costly and depending on which country you live, may not have access to a live broadcast of a tournament due to geo-restrictions. Another roadblock are blackout policies which prevent certain locations from streaming an event due to TV station broadcasting rights. Fortunately you can bypass these restrictions using a VPN and masking your actual IP address.
