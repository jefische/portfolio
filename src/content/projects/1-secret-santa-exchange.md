Elecretanta is a web application that transforms the traditional Secret Santa experience by combining thoughtful technology with the joy of giving.

Born from a December 2024 hackathon for the [Let's Get Technical](https://github.com/LetsGetTechnical) discord community, this project was a collaborative effort of 10 talented developers led by a senior engineer from Microsoft. The team built a comprehensive platform that solves one of gift exchange's biggest challenges: finding the perfect present.

The application streamlines the entire process—users create profiles detailing their hobbies, preferences, and interests, then organize gift exchange groups with customizable budgets. When it's time to draw names, Elecretanta's AI technology analyzes recipient profiles, considering everything from age group and hobbies to preference scales like "practical vs whimsical" and "cozy vs adventurous."

Using OpenAI's GPT models, the platform generates personalized gift suggestions complete with pricing, descriptions, match scores, and specific reasons why each gift suits the recipient. Product images are automatically fetched to help gifters visualize their options.

The result? No more generic gifts collecting dust in closets. Elecretanta ensures every Secret Santa exchange delivers meaningful, memorable presents that recipients will actually love.
