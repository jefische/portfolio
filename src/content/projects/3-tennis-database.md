This full-stack web application is a searchable database of full-length professional tennis match videos. Users can easily search and filter matches by player names, tournaments, and surface types to quickly find relevant content.

The frontend is built with React and Bootstrap, using Vite for fast development and bundling. Filter state and search input are managed using React’s useState hook, allowing for a smooth and responsive user experience.

The backend is powered by Java Spring Express.js and MySQL, handling API requests and storing match metadata. The app is deployed via fly.io for fast and reliable hosting.

The codebase is structured as a monorepo, with clearly separated client and server directories for frontend and backend logic.

Below is a snapshot of the main archive section.
