Talon Grips is a Colorado based small business manufacturing and selling gun grips for customers online and with approved dealers. After my employer, BlueChannel, provided a proof of concept design for the client, a full site rebuild of their e-commerce site began using a Big Commerce platform. As a frontend developer I was tasked with helping translate the figma design to code using a combination of SCSS, HTML handlebars, and Javascript.
