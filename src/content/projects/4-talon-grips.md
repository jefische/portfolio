Talon Grips is a Colorado based small business manufacturing and selling gun grips for customers online and with approved dealers. After my employer, BlueChannel, provided a proof of concept design for the client, a full site rebuild of their e-commerce site began using a Big Commerce platform which gave me exposure to HTML handlebars. As a frontend developer I was tasked with primarily helping translate the figma styling to code using a combination of traditional CSS and SCSS for better readability and variable management.
