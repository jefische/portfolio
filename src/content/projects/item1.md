This web project helps tennis fans navigate an alternative for watching tennis online. The site is setup as a single page web application with blog articles on how to watch professional tennis tournaments online and affiliate links for a vpn product. Everything is built entirely from scratch using React.js and Bootstrap for styling. Code is bundled for production using Vite and hosted on a Namecheap server.
