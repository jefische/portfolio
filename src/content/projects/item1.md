This is a custom built tic-tac-toe web application. The application has options to play against a computer that makes random moves, or against an intelligent computer player which implements the well known minimax algorithm. There is also an option to choose which player goes first. Note the user is always player 'X' and the computer is always 'O'. Finally there is an added feature to visualize the minimax algorithm decision tree.
