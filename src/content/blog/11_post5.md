This blog post will address the process for fetching data from MongoDB, and passing the appropriate video data down as props to populate the sidebar filters, and the
video cards in the main content section. In development I also have a video adding form and a video delete button, which after each of these actions are completed the videos should re-sort as state updates will propogate through all nested components.
