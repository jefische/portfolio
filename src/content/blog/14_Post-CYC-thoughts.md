## Initial thoughts on CYC

On the second day of the Commit Your Code conference, hosted at Yum! Brands International headquarters in Plano, Texas, the keynote opening speech was delivered by Aaron Francis. Aaron is a Laravel developer and a great speaker.

His speech was motivational and focused around how newer developers trying to break into the field or developers who have been around awhile can grow their presence online and build a network that will help us when we need it most. I.E. Getting laid off, or being at a terrible job where we need to make a change.

## Become known for a thing

Choose something I want to explore, a technical topic, something that I find interesting and start writing about it. Have a voice about it online. Don't worry about being an expert, just start learning and talking about it. And if it turns out it's not something you really enjoy talking about, switch and choose something else.

Aaron decided to be known as the database guy for PHP apps. In his previous career as an account, he was the spreadsheet guy. That's what he started writing and talking about online.

- Algorithms: For example exploring minimax and talking about the use cases
- MCP servers

- Mapbox and leaflet for mappings
