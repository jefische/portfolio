## CV

This section uses the TimeLine.astro component and cv.astro page to render my curriculum vitae. The import TimeLineElement uses an arbitrary name to then build html tags. The time-line-container class is defined in global.css to merely hide the final connecting line from the last bullet or bubble using display hide.
